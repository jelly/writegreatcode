# Numeric Representation

A number is an intangible, abstract concept. It is an intellectual device that we use to denote a
quantity. For example the value 100 can be represented in several different representations:

| 100         | decimal representation |
| C           | Roman numeral representation |
| 64_16       | base 16/hexadecimal representation |
| 1100100_2   | base two/binary representation |
| one hundred | English representation |

# Numbering Systems

A numbering system is a mechanism we use to represent numeric values. Most often the decimal
numbering system is used (base 10). 

The decimal positional notation (base 10) represents numbers using strings of Arabic numerals.
